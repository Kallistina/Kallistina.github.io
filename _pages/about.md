## About Me

Hi there! Iâ€™m **Kalliopi Christina Despotidou** â€” I hold a BSc in Informatics and Telecommunications from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, where I built a solid background in software engineering, AI and wireless communications. 

Right now, I'm diving deeper into network engineering through my MSc, focusing on wireless networks and network security â€” two fields I'm really passionate about.
